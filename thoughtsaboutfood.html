Welcome to my professional portfolio.</p><br>
<p class = "blurb">
For me food has always been intimately intertwined with learning and cultural exchange. I have been a professional cook for the majority of my life, and now that my body is preventing me from being able to handle the physical toll of a professional kitchen, I&#8217m still not ready to leave my obsession with food behind, because my obsession with food is also an obsession with human connection and cultural exchange. </p>
<p class = "blurb">As the resident food expert in my Japanese class in college, my instructor sent a native Japanese student to me for help. She didn&#8217t know how to cook. She had a cookbook, in Japanese, which she could read, but couldn&#8217t make sense of the complexities of the instructions. Together, we parsed the text of the recipes, her translating the language, and me translating how to flow from text to action, and how to make the recipes into something delicious. Together, we both learned how to cook several dishes. Together we both learned how to cook Japanese food, which neither of us knew before. This led to several discussions on how large of an issue learning to cook was for her, and discussions of gender roles and necessary knowledge in her native culture. We both learned about the culture of the other from something as simple as a cookbook. She later gave me the book as a gift, and I used it with others, both as a difficult translation piece for learning the language, and as a cookbook, to learn to make other dishes together.</p>
<p class = "blurb">Another student and I had a regular meal exchange, where we would bring one another meals to share at the library when we worked opposite shifts. She had a delicious recipe for &#8217&#8217Mexican Bean Salad,&#8217&#8217 and we had several discussions on cultural appropriation and naming conventions, because the dish in question resembled nothing Mexican in terms of flavor palette and many of the ingredients were not native to Mexico, or even South America. As far as we could tell, it was named Mexican because it contained beans and corn, but the ingredients were used and flavored without any Mexican cooking conventions or flavors. Bear in mind that neither of us understood the words &#8217&#8217cultural appropriation,&#8217&#8217 but we understood the concept because of our discussions. We learned about our own culture, and researched another culture, because of an oddly named dish. We taught ourselves and one another complex social concepts because of food.</p>
<p class = "blurb">A fellow library employee one summer was from Bangladesh. When I expressed interest in the food of her culture, she made some, and taught me about the proper, polite, and appropriate ways to eat with my hands, because in her area of the world, they didn&#8217t use silverware. This led to an intense discussion of Western bathroom habits, and how she viewed toilet paper as not clean enough. She was used to a culture where people eat with their hands, and so, when one uses the bathroom in Bangladesh, one washes thoroughly with soap and water, followed by another thorough hand-washing. She felt out of sorts in the dormitory, and felt the need to take a brief shower every time she used the restroom. A discussion of food led me to a human picture of life in another culture, and a sympathy for her culture shock that I had no idea about before. We both learned about each other, and I have a great respect for people that eat with their hands, because it is very difficult, and a greater empathy for differences in culture. One cannot devalue a culture based on supposed primitiveness. These concepts arose from a simple discussion of the food of another country.</p>
<p class = "blurb">My Japanese teacher hosted a Japanese festival at the college, with multiple areas for cultural exchange and information. She brought a few friends from the community to help her serve sushi to the attendees. There was a larger crowd than expected. Myself, and another friend from Japanese class that I had learned to make sushi with, rolled up our sleeves and helped the older Japanese ladies make sushi for all the students and faculty that attended. We laughed and joked with them, and tried to impress one another with our speed and delicacy. I made several friends that day with the Japanese immigrant women who were impressed with our sushi skills. We made real human connections with people from another culture, because of a plate of food.</p>
<p class = "blurb">Food for me has always been synonymous with learning, both of an academic, and non-academic sort. Forming real human connections is so easy through food because it is something that we all share, and yet is different for every person and every culture. Things I never would have thought of before often come up in conversations about food. It is such a casual subject, and an easy way to start a conversation in order to learn more about someone far different from myself. Food is a big part of me and I do not think I will ever be ready to leave my obsession with it behind, because it matters to everyone. Food is a universal, but at the same time innately specific and unique, and for that reason it is an amazing way to learn things that cannot be simply taught.
